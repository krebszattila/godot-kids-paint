# Kids Paint #

A painting application for kids created with the awesome [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

Originally created for my kids to learn how to use a computer mouse.

The main goal was to create a painting app which is fun to use and childproof.

## Features ##

* 4 drawing tools: pencil, brush, bucket and airbrush
* 3 different tool sizes
* A complete 12 color palette
* Drawing sound effects
* Undo-redo functions
* Save function

## Restrictions ##

To make the application childproof the following restrictions were introduced:

* The app can't be (accidentally) closed with the mouse
    * To save the image, change the settings or exit the app you have to use the keyboard
* Right mouse button click or mouse wheel scrolling has no effect
* The canvas cannot be resized, there is no zooming or scrolling
* The available tools and the color palette are limited, the colors can't be customized

## How to use ##

* Select a tool, a tool size and a color and start painting
* If you make a mistake (happy little accident) use the undo/redo buttons
* Press the ESC key to open the main menu where you can:
    * Create a new empty drawing
    * Save your drawing as PNG
    * Access the settings menu
    * Read the license informations
    * Exit the application


## Download

The application can be downloaded from [Itch.io](https://crabsatos.itch.io/kids-paint).
